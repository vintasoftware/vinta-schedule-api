## Completed Phases

### Phase 0 — Shared context, utils module, and lru_cache fix ✅
- **Status**: complete, PR open
- **Model**: claude-sonnet-4-6 (plan tier: Tier 3) + fixer (claude-sonnet-4-6)
- **Branch**: `plan/calendar-service-refactor/phase-0` (base `plan/calendar-service-refactor/wt`)
- **PR**: https://github.com/vintasoftware/vinta-schedule-api/pull/65 (status=published, 5 inline comments)
- **Files**: `calendar_integration/services/calendar_service_context.py` (new), `calendar_integration/services/calendar_service_utils.py` (new), `calendar_integration/services/calendar_service.py` (edited), `calendar_integration/tests/services/test_calendar_service_utils.py` (new)
- **Summary**: Added `CalendarServiceContext` frozen dataclass (built once in `authenticate()`/`initialize_without_provider()`, consumed by sub-services in later phases). Moved cross-cutting helpers (timezone conversion, event serialization family, permission-granting, calendar lookups) into `calendar_service_utils.py` as module-level functions; facade methods delegate to them as thin wrappers. Fixed the multi-tenant `lru_cache` bug: calendar lookups now use a per-instance dict keyed on `(organization_id, id_or_external_id)`, reset on every (re)auth — replacing `@lru_cache` which could leak another org's Calendar. Regression test added.
- **Review**: Layer-3 found 0 blockers; fixer reverted an unsanctioned behavior change in `serialize_event_data_input` (restored byte-for-byte, pinned the preserved latent bug with a test), hoisted late imports, added the mandated delegation test + resource-path test.
- **Gate**: calendar_integration suite 1014 passed; full suite 1563 passed + 1 pre-existing unrelated failure (`accounts/.../test_send_unknown_account_sms_success`).
- **Carry-forward notes**:
  - `CalendarServiceContext` is built but NOT yet consumed — Phase 2+ sub-services receive it (perf guardrail: authenticate once).
  - Per-instance calendar cache is unbounded (vs old `maxsize=128`) — acceptable now; revisit if a long-lived sync iterates thousands of calendars.
  - Latent bug in `serialize_event_data_input` resources branch deliberately preserved + pinned by a test; a real fix is out of scope (candidate Open-Questions follow-up).

### Phase 1 — Extract RecurrenceManager helper ✅
- **Status**: complete, PR open
- **Model**: claude-opus-4-7 (plan tier: Tier 4) + fixer (claude-sonnet-4-6)
- **Branch**: `plan/calendar-service-refactor/phase-1` (base `…/phase-0`)
- **PR**: https://github.com/vintasoftware/vinta-schedule-api/pull/68 (published, 3 inline comments)
- **Files**: `calendar_integration/services/recurrence_manager.py` (new), `calendar_integration/services/calendar_service.py` (edited, −222 lines), `calendar_integration/tests/services/test_recurrence_manager.py` (new, 9 tests)
- **Summary**: Extracted the two generic recurrence engines (`create_recurring_exception_generic`, `create_recurring_bulk_modification_generic`) into a stateless `RecurrenceManager`. Engines take `CalendarServiceContext` as first param (only `self` use was the auth guard); per-type truncate/continuation/record callbacks stay caller-supplied. Facade delegates at 6 call sites; engine methods deleted. Bodies moved byte-for-byte (reviewer diff-verified).
- **Review**: Layer-3 0 blockers (engine bodies byte-identical, guard equivalent, call sites correct). Fixer added a direct master-date exception-branch test.
- **Gate**: calendar suite 1023 passed; full suite 1572 passed + 1 pre-existing unrelated failure.
- **Carry-forward notes**:
  - `RecurrenceManager` is stateless + never imports `CalendarService` — Phase 2 (`CalendarEventService`) and Phase 4 (`AvailabilityService`) will delegate to it for their recurrence methods, passing the context.
  - Bare-`raise` defensive lines in the guard blocks are verbatim-preserved dead code (guard raises internally first) — leave until Phase 7 if ever.

### Phase 2 — Extract CalendarEventService ✅
- **Status**: complete, PR open
- **Model**: claude-opus-4-7 (plan tier: Tier 4) + fixer (claude-sonnet-4-6, mypy narrowing)
- **Branch**: `plan/calendar-service-refactor/phase-2` (base `…/phase-1`)
- **PR**: https://github.com/vintasoftware/vinta-schedule-api/pull/72 (published, 4 inline comments)
- **Files**: `calendar_integration/services/calendar_event_service.py` (new, ~1410 lines), `calendar_integration/services/calendar_service.py` (edited, −1000 lines), `calendar_integration/tests/services/test_calendar_event_service.py` (new)
- **Summary**: Moved 11 event methods (single + recurring CRUD, transfer, expansion reads, event recurrence exception/bulk-mod) into `CalendarEventService`. Facade delegates via `self._get_event_service()`. Bodies byte-for-byte; `@transaction.atomic()` moved with create/update/delete.
- **Key design — host seam**: service reaches not-yet-extracted collaborators via an `EventServiceHost` Protocol (facade passed as `host=self`): bundle fan-out (Phase 3), `get_availability_windows_in_range` (Phase 4), shared write-adapter/permission helpers. Chosen over a frozen snapshot because existing tests patch these on the facade instance + mutate account/adapter post-auth. `_get_event_service()` rebuilds a context snapshot per call (cheap dataclass, NO re-auth/adapter rebuild → perf guardrail holds); shares `_calendar_cache` + `RecurrenceManager` by reference.
- **Review**: Layer-3 0 blockers (bodies byte-identical, atomic preserved, transfer_event host-routing == original call graph, snapshot parity confirmed). Fixer fixed a ~30-error mypy `union-attr` regression by narrowing a bare `context = cast(...)` local through the TypeGuards (runtime-identical; file mypy 50→20, remainder pre-existing).
- **Gate**: full suite 1579 passed, 0 failed (after rebase onto main's SMS fix).
- **Carry-forward notes (CRITICAL for Phase 3/4)**:
  - Phase 3 (`CalendarBundleService`) must be supplied to the event service in place of the host's `_create_bundle_event`/`_update_bundle_event`/`_delete_bundle_event` methods — the seam is the `EventServiceHost` protocol; update `_get_event_service()` wiring + the host methods, do NOT change `CalendarEventService` call sites.
  - Phase 4 (`AvailabilityService`) similarly replaces the host's `get_availability_windows_in_range`.
  - Bundle helpers `_create_bundle_event`/`_update_bundle_event`/`_delete_bundle_event` still live on the facade — these are what Phase 3 extracts.
  - The mypy-narrowing pattern (`context = cast("BaseCalendarService", self._context)` then guard) is the standard for sub-service methods reading context fields — reuse it in Phases 3-6.

## Rebase log
- 2026-06-13: rebased the whole stack (`wt`→`phase-0`→`phase-1`→`phase-2`) onto `origin/main` (3286b69) after the twilio/SMS-adapter test fix landed on main (commit "fix(account-adapter): update SMS notification method to use notification service"). Conflict-free. Force-pushed `wt`/`phase-0`/`phase-1`; PRs #65/#68 auto-updated. The previously-noted "1 pre-existing failure" is now resolved on main — full suite is 0 failures from Phase 2 onward.

### Phase 3 — Extract CalendarBundleService ✅
- **Status**: complete, PR open
- **Model**: claude-sonnet-4-6 (plan tier: Tier 3)
- **Branch**: `plan/calendar-service-refactor/phase-3` (base `…/phase-2`)
- **PR**: https://github.com/vintasoftware/vinta-schedule-api/pull/74 (published, 3 inline comments)
- **Files**: `calendar_integration/services/calendar_bundle_service.py` (new, ~545 lines), `calendar_integration/services/calendar_service.py` (edited, −312 lines), `calendar_integration/tests/services/test_calendar_bundle_service.py` (new, 29 tests)
- **Summary**: Moved the 7 bundle methods into `CalendarBundleService`. Reused the host-seam pattern (`BundleServiceHost`, facade = host); facade `create_bundle_calendar`/`update_bundle_calendar` delegate; the Phase-2 `EventServiceHost` bundle methods (`_create_bundle_event`/etc.) now route to the bundle service. `_get_bundle_service()` mirrors `_get_event_service()`. No construction cycle (facade mediates); children validated non-BUNDLE so no recursive fan-out.
- **Review**: Layer-3 0 blockers / 0 should-fix. Bodies byte-for-byte (child reconciliation set math, primary selection, attendee dedup all diffed identical); `@transaction.atomic()` preserved; dropped org-checks were dead code (guard raises first).
- **Gate**: full suite 1608 passed, 0 failed. mypy net 141→138 (no new context-field union-attr; reused narrowing pattern).
- **Carry-forward notes**:
  - Phase 4 (`AvailabilityService`) replaces the host's `get_availability_windows_in_range` (declared on both `EventServiceHost` and `BundleServiceHost`). Same seam-swap pattern.
  - Phase 7 cleanup list now includes: drop redundant facade-level `@transaction.atomic()` on the 1-line bundle + event delegations (harmless nested savepoints today); revisit whether the `InitializedOrAuthenticatedCalendarService` protocol should keep declaring `_get_primary_calendar`/`_collect_bundle_attendees`/serialize helpers (facade keeps thin delegations for them only to satisfy the protocol).

### Phase 4 — Extract AvailabilityService ✅
- **Status**: complete, PR open
- **Model**: claude-opus-4-7 (Tier 4) — implemented across 3 sessions (2 died on API socket errors mid-extraction; finished by sonnet finishing agents)
- **Branch**: `plan/calendar-service-refactor/phase-4` (base `…/phase-3`)
- **PR**: https://github.com/vintasoftware/vinta-schedule-api/pull/75 (published, 3 inline comments)
- **Files**: `calendar_integration/services/availability_service.py` (new, ~1095 lines), `calendar_integration/services/calendar_service.py` (edited, −668 lines → facade now 2557 lines), `calendar_integration/tests/services/test_availability_service.py` (new, 11 tests)
- **Summary**: Moved 17 availability/blocked/available methods + interval-math privates into `AvailabilityService`. Same host-seam pattern (`AvailabilityServiceHost`, reads events via `host.get_calendar_events_expanded`). Facade keeps 2 private delegations: `_subtract_busy_intervals` (`@staticmethod` — test calls it unbound) + `_remove_available_time_windows_that_overlap...` (instance). `get_availability_windows_in_range` host method routes to the service.
- **Review**: Layer-3 0 blockers / 0 should-fix. Interval math + all 8 recurring methods diffed byte-identical; no infinite loop; perf guardrail (no added queries in loops) held; tenancy preserved.
- **Gate**: full suite 1619 passed, 0 failed. mypy 138 (0 new — 3 attr-defined fixed via `InitializedOrAuthenticatedCalendarService` cast; 7 remaining verbatim from facade).
- **Carry-forward notes**:
  - Facade is now ~2557 lines (was 4726). Remaining on it: auth/init, adapter resolution, calendar CRUD (create_application/virtual_calendar), org-resource import, the sync state machine (Phase 5), webhooks (Phase 6), + the thin private delegations.
  - Phase 7 cleanup list += export `AvailabilityService` from `services/__init__.py`; the `_remove_...` cast-style note.
  - NOTE: long opus agents are hitting ~45min API socket timeouts — for Phase 5 (sync, the most coupled), consider checkpointing or expect to finish via a follow-up agent if it dies mid-extraction. The pattern: dead agents leave correct partial work on disk (uncommitted); verify via the suite, then a small finishing agent completes tests+commit.

### Phase 5 — Extract CalendarSyncService ✅
- **Status**: complete, PR open
- **Model**: claude-opus-4-7 (Tier 4) — completed in one session (checkpoint-commit strategy used; survived)
- **Branch**: `plan/calendar-service-refactor/phase-5` (base `…/phase-4`)
- **PR**: https://github.com/vintasoftware/vinta-schedule-api/pull/76 (published, 3 inline comments)
- **Files**: `calendar_integration/services/calendar_sync_service.py` (new, ~992 lines), `calendar_integration/services/calendar_service.py` (edited, −656 lines → facade now 1985 lines), `calendar_integration/tests/services/test_calendar_sync_service.py` (new, 3 tests)
- **Summary**: Moved the import/sync state machine (6 public + ~11 internal diff/merge methods) into `CalendarSyncService`. Same host-seam (`SyncServiceHost`). Sync reads via `context.calendar_adapter`, writes via the same bulk ops; routes availability/permission + a couple inner calls back through host. Many sync privates kept as facade delegations (tests call them directly).
- **Review**: Layer-3 0 blockers / 0 should-fix. Diff/merge byte-identical (bulk field lists verified); host self-routing verified non-recursive; external Celery/org callers unaffected.
- **Gate**: full suite 1622 passed, 0 failed. mypy 7 in new file all verbatim-from-original.
- **Carry-forward notes**:
  - Facade now 1985 lines (was 4726, −58%). Remaining: auth/init/adapter resolution, calendar CRUD (create_application/virtual_calendar), webhooks (Phase 6), permission-granting helpers, + many thin private delegations.
  - Phase 7 cleanup list += drop redundant facade `@transaction.atomic()` on `import_account_calendars` delegation; remove stale `_process_events_for_sync`/`_link_orphaned_recurring_instances` from the `AuthenticatedCalendarService` protocol; add a direct orphan-link unit test (currently integration-covered).
  - Checkpoint strategy (commit extraction before tests) worked well for the long extraction — reuse if Phase 6 runs long.

## Current Phase
- Phase 6 — Extract `CalendarWebhookService` (next).

## Remaining Phases
- Phase 6 — Extract `CalendarWebhookService` (Tier 3)
- Phase 7 — Shrink the facade and finalize wiring (Tier 2)

## Deferred Phases
- None (no cross-repo phases; no feature-flag-removal phase — pure refactor).
